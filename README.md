# ARES - A Web Admin Framework

This is a module based MVC Framework based on PHP/JS to create Admin Panels with ease.

You can easily use this framework through Different **Releases** or using the composer

```
composer create-project apollyon/ares
```

## What this provides

This provides a ready to go base for Admin Panel ready to be extended with add-on modules that can be installed.

## Components

Backend is created completely based on PHP with all the backend processing logic and Database connectivity logic implemented in it.

While the Frontend and Presentation Logic is developed with React which interfaces with our backend through exposed APIs.

1. Module Installer System in Framework
2. Drag and Drop based Module Generator for Ares
3. A System to Generate Installers for Individual Module Files
4. Documentation
